## version 1.1

Significant changes to main POSAC function to avoid problems with non-convergence.

POSAC function now returns a matrix of monotonicity coefficients of original variables with the derived features.

movecheck function updated so that it runs far more quickly.

Functions Ufunc, dUfunc, realU, resortPOSAC and resortPOSAC2 all removed as they are no longer required.
